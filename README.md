# Launchpad.js

Interact with your launchpads in Node.js

This project started as a module for my own stream system to make several things interact with OBS studio, named [rewards-interaction][rewards-interaction].
After re-writing a broken launchpad library I decided to release the library to the public so everyone can enjoy easy programming on their launchpad.

### Launchpad models currently supported
- Launchpad MK2
